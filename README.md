###Contributing###

####Pull Requests###
If you have an idea for a feature or have a bug that you'd like to fix, please fork this repo to a private repo of your own. If your contribution is more than some small tweak, create a branch. Do your thing, and then submit a pull request.

####Issue Tracking####
Please make use of github's issue tracker for this repo

###Justification of Privacy###
Since this is the source of an internal site, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to throw it up on a public repo.  It's fairly easy to get free private repos from github, just visit https://github.com/edu and do what it says.
